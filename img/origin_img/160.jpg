            <p>Wikispaces was founded in 2005 and has since been used by educators, companies and individuals across the globe. </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the time has come where we have had to make the difficult business decision to end the Wikispaces service.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>We first announced the site closure in January 2018, through a site-wide banner that appeared to all logged-in users and needed to be clicked on to dismiss</p>
              <p>During the closure period a range of banners were shown to users, including a countdown banner in the final month. Additionally, the home page of Wikispaces.com became a blog, detailing the reasons for the closure. Private Label Site Administrators were contacted separately regarding the closure</p>

          <p><strong>Why has Wikispaces closed?</strong></p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Approximately 18 months ago, we completed a technical review of the infrastructure and software we used to serve Wikispaces users. As part of the review, it became apparent that the required investment to bring the infrastructure and code in line with modern standards was very substantial. We explored all possible options for keeping Wikispaces running but had to conclude that it was no longer viable to continue to run the service in the long term. So, sadly, we had to close the site - but we have been touched by the messages from users all over the world who began creating wikis with it and now running them on new platforms.</p>
