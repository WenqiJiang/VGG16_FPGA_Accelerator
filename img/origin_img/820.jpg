Zhuhai Opera House</h4>
<p>Inspired by the Sydney Opera House, but looks like two UFOs have crashed into the earth. Or two very large macaroons, or more to the point of reality, two massive clam shells &#8211; which makes sense as just like Sydney’s iconic trendsetter, the Zhuhai Opera House is located next to a beautiful expanse of water. It is endowed with world-advanced acousto-optic and stage technical effects. The Concert Hall has 1,600 seats, a lobby, auditorium, and stage for broad-scale musical drama, musicals, ballet, stage drama, symphonies, chamber music, opera and other large-scale performances and variety shows. With floor space of nearly 50,000 square metres, the opera house cost 1.08 billion yuan ($158 million). Some say it&#8217;s shaped as scallops to represent the brilliant sun and entrancing moon, the landmark opera house is the first on-island theater in the Chinese mainland.</p>
<h4>2. Guangzhou</h4>
<p>Guangzhou is at the heart of the most-populous built-up metropolitan area in mainland China that extends into the neighbouring cities of Foshan, Dongguan, Zhongshan and Shenzhen, forming one of the largest urban agglomerations on the planet. In 2015, the city&#8217;s administrative area was estimated to have a population of 13,501,100. Guangzhou is ranked as an Alpha global city. There is a rapidly increasing number of foreign temporary residents and immigrants from Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Africa. This has led to it being dubbed the &#8220;Capital of the Third World&#8221;.</p>

<h4>3. The Temple of Heaven</h4>
<p>Beijing’s 25 million inhabitants have some great cultural treasures, most of which are over-run by tourists, but simply have to be seen anyway. But the Temple of Heaven is one of my ultimate favourites. It’s on a par with Paris’s Arc de Triomphe, being not the highest publicity icon, but something that has mystique, power, and which evokes a spiritual response.</p>
<h4>4. Tiananmen Square, Beijing</h4>
<p>Named after the Tiananmen (&#8220;Gate of Heavenly Peace&#8221;) located to its north, separating it from the Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square contains the Monument to the People&#8217;s Heroes, the Great Hall of the People, the National Museum of China, and the Mausoleum of Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong proclaimed the founding of the People&#8217;s Republic of China in the square on October 1, 1949; the anniversary of this event is still observed there.</p>

<h4>5. The Friendship Bridge Between Dandong &amp; North Korea</h4>
<p>Glimpsing North Korea from across the two-part Sino-Korean Friendship Bridge is simply exciting. North Korea looks extremely beautiful from across the Yalu River, and yet there’s this captivating undercurrent of fear. The spectre of Kim Jong Un casts a nuclear shadow across the landscape, where every factory on the edge of the river feels like it’s probably a chemical weapons factory. Walking to the end of the original bridge, halfway across the river, is so poignant &#8211; it was bombed by the Americans during the Korean War and has stayed bombed. What a remarkable artefact.</p>
<h4>6. Shanghai</h4>
<p>The whole city is just awesome! Shanghai has been described as the &#8220;showpiece&#8221; of the booming economy of mainland China, renowned for its Lujiazui skyline, and museums and historic buildings, such as those along The Bund, as well as the City God Temple and the Yu Garden.</p>

<h4>7. Shuiwan Road, Zhuhai</h4>
<p>A street full of bars. It seems that each one is dedicated to making the loudest music possible to drown out their competition next door. Not a place for quiet conversation. A lively place especially at weekends.</p>
<h4>8. Shenzhen Airport</h4>
<p>A modern wonder, with the most dazzling ceiling which seems to go on forever. If this is what contemporary Chinese architecture can produce, I’m a fan. This airport get the award for best transition to modern times and very rightfully too. What a design &#8211; simply fantastic. This is beautiful architecture, an ultra modern design that is light and airy. Services and facilities are first rate. It&#8217;s probably the nicest airport in China. Good signage and easy to navigate without a translator. Strongly recommended to go through this Airport to see what the Chinese can do to an airport. Simply brilliant.</p>

<h4>9.Wangfujing Snack Street, Beijing</h4>
<p>Located south to the Haoyou Shijie Shopping Mall on the Wangfujing Shopping Street, the Wangfujing Snack Street is easy to spot with its ancient Chinese style gateway. The street covers over 2,000 square meters and offers some 500 snacks from all over China. You can also find the time-honoured brands of traditional Beijing snacks, like Baodu Feng (quick-fried tripe) and Doufunao Bai (jellied bean curd). Even if only in Beijing for five days, you can easily find yourself here almost by accident at least three times &#8211; your stomach will draw you towards it.</p>
<h4>10. The Great Wall of China</h4>
<p>Seen from anywhere, from any angle, whether below it, on it, or above it, the scale of the Great Wall of China can never be forgotten. An astounding 21,196 kilometres long, the Great Wall has been rebuilt, maintained, and enhanced over various dynasties; the majority of the existing wall is from the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). The defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced by the construction of watch towers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and the fact that the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor. The Great Wall is generally regarded as one of the most impressive architectural feats in history.</p>

		<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="http://www.monkeyday.org/">Monkey</a> is the playful spirit of the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-15/chinese-new-year-of-the-monkey-sculpture-national-library/7168486">Chinese</a> zodiac; always ready with a joke or a trick. In the Year of the Monkey get ready for some twists and turns. Money is an important ingredient in this Year of the Red Monkey; red because it is in the element of fire. Status will be another issue on the agenda this year and we could see lots of leadership changes at the top. Especially in the finance industry and, perhaps, Treasurers and Finance Ministers, may find themselves at the centre of controversies around the globe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Watch your investments and make sure that you read the fine print. Closer to home it is behoven upon us all to take responsibility for our own fiscal realities. Don’t go blaming others after the fact, be vigilant now and don’t believe the hype. Monkeys like to hype things up and make a song and dance about it all. Stay calm and centred, and try not to get caught up in the drama. There are opportunities for those who can remain unfazed. Economically these opportunities may present themselves in the wake of those who have unfortunately gone down with the ship.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Zodiac Forecasts for The Year of the Monkey</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Currency markets may be quite volatile in the Year of the Red Monkey. Rising and falling currencies can affect exchange rates for the tourist and travellers. Be careful about how you exchange your currency when travelling, as there could be opportunities for profit and losses could occur for the unwary. Avoid black marketeers in countries that have these elements in play. Be vigilant when bartering in Asian countries to avoid being ripped off unnecessarily. Keep your traveller’s cheques and money close to your person in a safe place when in public places. <a href="http://www.psychiccentral.com.au/">Astrology and numerology</a>, often come to the fore in the Year of the <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/news/plants_animals/monkeys/">Monkey</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.news.com.au/technology/science/animals/monkey-business-as-chimp-escapes-zoo/news-story/6ced79a5bece9dca457cb34a47b19b7b">Monkeys</a> can be quite vicious when provoked, so avoid quarrels and disputes when travelling. Remaining calm and centred, whenever possible, is a good strategy to follow at the best of times, but in the volatile Year of the Monkey it is a must. Avoid political arguments when out and about in foreign countries; especially in the current political climate. Keep your focus on the pathway, wherever you are, don’t get distracted by fireworks. It is easy to lose your way in unfamiliar circumstances, especially when travelling far from home. Don’t stray too far from the beaten track this year; keep your eye on the signs.</p>

		<p style="text-align: justify;">Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has millions of converts all over the West. These people shifted their allegiance to these older and more traditional means of healing because they could not find relief from allopathic medicine. Modern medicine in the West is in large part based on statistical medicine, it services large majorities of people and cannot help those who do not respond to the prescribed treatments proffered. Medicine in the West is a capitalistic, free enterprise business; and that is why we have Big Pharma. These huge corporations straddling the globe and controlling who gets what at what price for what conditions. Doctors are like middlemen writing prescriptions for the drugs produced by these mega-sized conglomerates and convincing their <a href="http://becuriousbefree.com/">patients</a> that they need them. One of the unforesen results has been a backlash called <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/medical-tourism/">medical tourism.</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Big Pharma’s cornucopia of drugs has been largely unsuccessful in effectively treating chronic health conditions in our societies. Asthma, allergies, CFS and many of the modern ailments do not respond to the pharmaceutical solutions currently in the chemist’s cupboards across the planet. Firstly, there was a loud denial from the <a href="http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2013/04/23/why-medical-tourism-australia-booming">medical</a> establishment and the business establishment that these conditions existed at all. The sufferers must be making up their numerous symptoms and inability to function, was the general consensus. Government health agencies and social programs allowed these people to fall painfully through the cracks.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Chinese Medicine Attracts Health-Conscious Tourists</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The heath carers who picked these people up and treated them were alternative practitioners; the previously marginalised among health professionals. They had been refused any recognised status by the jealous gods who ran the medical establishment and their government cohorts. All of a sudden, or so it seemed, thousands of people were seeking an alternative view about their health complaints. Even more startlingly, these people were finding cures and relief in these alternative treatments. Many of these treatments were based on the principles and practices of Chinese Medicine (TCM). Excessive and non-existent <a href="http://www.clinic66.com.au/menstrual-problems.asp">menstrual bleeding</a> are conditions that can benefit from TCM treatments.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the growing popularity more and more training schools popped up in America, Australia and Europe; demand was fed by supply. As more information became available Western students began studying in China. Eventually, health-conscious tourists began going to the source to seek treatments. There are still many sceptics among the medical fraternity here in the West; they feel that they are the only truly scientific solution to humanity’s <a href="https://ecolivingmagazine.com.au/health/">health</a> problems. There are also a small minority of doctors who have trained in both disciplines. The leading medical research journals in the West are full of <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B00KAU50SM">evidence based research</a> acknowledging the efficacy of many TCM practices. However, the medical establishment manages by dint of Big Pharma’s deep pockets to keep the media’s spotlight firmly on its own drug based expensive solutions.</p>

		<p style="text-align: justify;">Well-spoken Chinese presenters are in demand for English-speaking tours around China for Westerners. Do you speak very good English? Is the timbre of your voice very attractive and a good representation of our Chinese country? In that case you can get a job as a presenter on one of these <a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Mj00CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=chinese+tour+guide+news+stories&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lbQ40yq8J6&amp;sig=VbUwdt5EQYk6gQ_ZYZyVcXmDvd8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiou5H3vOfMAhXQQpQKHTS4BmQQ6AEIRTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=chinese%20tour%20guide%20news%20stories&amp;f=false">popular tours</a>. Imagine being able to tell the story of your great nation to the foreign hordes; what a proud position to be in. Narrating some of the many achievements garnered by the heroes and heroines of the Middle Kingdom.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Well-Spoken Chinese Presenters in Demand</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Attractive and well-spoken Chinese presenters will be assured of good remuneration for these important positions. An attractive speaking voice is vital if the applicant is to be successful in applying for this position. Based on the well-known truism that ‘they do shoot the messenger’, especially if he, or she, sounds like a screeching owl in pain. Dulcet tones will sell the story of China’s rich and rewarding history, much better than adenoidal pitches of harsh sounds. A warm and nurturing voice can be honey-sweet to the ears of its listener. The tours will then enjoy their time as audience for our <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/world/strongarm-tour-guides-force-chinese-tourists-to-shop-20151022-gkfipr.html">tour guides</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Across the land from Beijing to Shanghai, Szechwan to Altay, and Hangzhou to Qoqek our <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-36139230">tour</a> buses are crying out for well-spoken tour guides. Get on board and pin your microphone on and start talking; your country needs you. Tell our stories to these <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/915773/tour-firms-struggle-with-lack-of-chinese-speaking-guides">visitors</a> and tell them proudly. Tell them of the mighty Qing dynasty and its battles to unite our great nation. With a population well over a billion people we have many such stories to tell of our histories. The mighty Yellow River has countless stories to be told. Our country covers 9.6 billion square kilometres and every patch has a story to be shared.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From the Tibetan Plateau all the way to the Pacific Ocean history has accrued like money in a Swiss Bank. Dynasties have come and gone like waves crashing into the beach; always to be replaced with another. The Communist Party of China waves the red flag now over the capital. Memories of Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai flutter across brain cells like rice thrown at a wedding. Children of the revolution stand together and their shadows are hardly seen. Chopsticks hover above an empty bowl. The wind blows across a chasm; and it will be the story that you tell that makes an impression. Speak well about your country and know that you serve the pages of our history.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p style="text-align: justify;">China is a developing country; it is also the world’s most populous nation. <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/china/21649540-waste-incinerators-rile-public-are-much-better-landfill-keep-fires-burning">Waste management</a> has not been high on its agenda, as it has been involved in a massive modernisation and urbanisation program for a number of decades. China has been thrust into the focus of the developed world because of its rapidly growing economic might and because of global warming. Suddenly, what China did domestically, was now very important to the rest of the world, in terms of greenhouse gases produced. There has been pressure from environmentalists and developing nations for them to reduce the number of coal fired power stations they have.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking at the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-17782718">waste management issue,</a> China produces some three hundred million tons of waste per year. Due to the urbanisation within the country and the shift to a consumerist lifestyle, this massive amount of packaging waste is stressing an underdeveloped public waste management system. It is unsorted municipal waste, which is picked up by trucks and disposed of in landfills and waste incinerators on the edges of the cities. Currently, government waste management services do not have the capacity to provide a recycling system. There needs to be much more investment here.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Waste Management in China: An Eco-Disaster</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This eco-disaster is also an eco-challenge for China. The composition of the majority of the solid waste matter being disposed of is organic. The problem with organic matter in landfill is that it does not decompose properly in the anaerobic conditions. Rather, it produces methane, more greenhouse gas. An education program needs to be instigated to make Chinese residents aware of the problems and the part that they can play in the solution. The Chinese government needs to lead the way, as government bodies in Western nations have done in bringing in new recycling programs and promoting them to their citizens.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wastemanagements.com.au">Taking advice from Australian waste management companies</a> could be another short-cut for the Chinese. Opening the waste market up to private enterprise will speed up the process of making waste profitable. Organic waste can produce energy and recycling can generate profits in a number of areas. Societies have to pay for their waste, both residents and commercial interests, and this then <a href="https://ecolivingmagazine.com.au/2015/05/19/eco-friendly-waste-management/">turns a problem into an opportunity</a>. Waste management in China: An eco-disaster which can become an <a href="http://www.thenatureofcities.com/2015/02/01/ways-forward-from-chinas-urban-waste-problem/">eco-challenge</a>. It is as much a mind-set thing as it is anything else; China must understand the consequences of not properly managing its waste and then set the economic levers in place to clean it up and profit from it.</p>

		<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ever since mid-June of last year, the Chinese Stock Market has been </span><span class="s1">constantly oscillating. When the Chinese Government decided to devaluate its Yuan, some economists feared that it will have a significant effect on the global economy and the <a href="https://www.australianlendingcentre.com.au/interest-rates/">interest rates</a> of <a href="https://www.australianlendingcentre.com.au/interest-rates/"><span class="s2">financial institutions</span></a>. A report from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/08/12/chinas-currency-devaluation-is-only-beginning/"><span class="s2">The Washington Post</span></a> said that China’s surprising move is a counter-measure in saving its economy. Ordinary Chinese citizens have also made <a href="http://socialmediamanagement.asia"><span class="s2">the buzz on Chinese social media</span></a> regarding this matter. But when did it all started?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Tracing the Devaluation of Yuan</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On August 11 of last year, the Chinese Central Bank devalued its currency by a record 1.9 percent against a basket of currencies, which is assumed to be dominated by the United State’s dollar. This “measure” is followed by a drop of 1.6 percent and 1.1 percent in just two days. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Based on the article of <a href="http://www.firstpost.com/business/slide-continues-investors-freaking-yuan-devalued-heres-2390720.html"><span class="s2">First Post Business</span></a>, the devaluation of the Yuan currency resulted to at least an $800 billion-loss of investments in the country as foreign investors and Chinese businessmen are tying their money to other countries. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Effects of the Slides in Yuan</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is said that the Chinese outbound tourism will be the first affected by this drop in Yuan. This means that more Chinese yuans (CNY) will be spent against the US dollars, yens or euros. The bottom line: tourists will have to cough out more money due to high Yuan to US dollar or yen or euro conversions. That being said, <a href="http://www.attractchina.com/blog/will-yuan-devaluation-affect-chinese-outbound-travel/"><span class="s2">Attract China</span></a> refuted that the recent drop of Yuan only had a slight effect on outbound tourism. In fact, 90 percent of international flights and tours have been booked for China’s Golden Week as of the article’s publishing. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In terms of inbound tourism, the Yuan slide is good news to foreign visitors. Almost everything will become way cheaper. For instance, the standard rate to an overnight stay at a Chinese hotel is 600 CNY. Prior to the devaluation, let’s say that the conversion rate of CNY to USD (hypothetical) is 6 CNY against USD. Therefore, a tourist will pay 100 USD for his/her hotel stay. But after the devaluation, CNY was set at a 6.8 per US dollar-basis (hypothetical). In effect, tourists will only have to pay around 88-89 USD for their hotel accommodation. </span></p>

		<p style="text-align: justify;"><del></del>China is a visually impressive nation to visit and the rich Chinese culture is alive with colour and pageantry. It is also a big country making it ideal for tourists of all persuasions. Chinese cuisines are famous all over the world, as Chinese migration has taken their dishes to markets throughout the West and beyond. Tours of <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/top_news.html">China</a> for deaf people are taking off, as both hearing impaired tourists and tour companies are realising the potential for enjoyment and profits. The Great Wall of China is no impediment to the deaf hordes now on its doorstep.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_in_China">Tourism in China</a> is big business, with more than sixty million people visiting the country each year; making it the third most popular destination in the world. The mix of urban and natural wonders make it a vibrant and dynamic place to visit. Disabled tourism is just getting started really, we already have plenty of medical tourism happening in China, and busloads of people who share the same <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-crime/article/1872834/hong-kong-tour-guide-reportedly-deaf-right-ear-after">disability</a> is kind of cool in a way. It also allows organisers and venues to properly accommodate these people at the time. Good preparation is what makes any adventure a success.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Tours of China for Deaf People</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://hearnet.org.au/hearing-technology/cochlear-implants">The Cochlear Implant</a> has made so many things possible for deaf people, like tours of China and other similar adventures. This wonderful invention has reduced the impact of hearing loss and turned up the sound on life. Audiologists have been singing the praises of this inner ear functioning replacement for many years. It takes the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1092849/Kiss-deaf-Chinese-girl-loses-hearing-passionate-kiss-ruptures-eardrum.html">deaf</a> out of leopard for head bangers. And puts the def into clearer sound definition. Watching the Chinese New Year celebrations without the clash of the symbols and the fireworks is just not the same.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Make sure that you visit China’s mountains, they are beautiful and magnificent. Mount Tai, Mount Hua, Mount Song, Mount Hua and Mount Hengshan are the Five Sacred Mountains. The Taishan massif snakes its way through Shandong and stands as sentinel over the lands and Chinese people. There are many waterfalls in south-western China, which are visually impressive and some say spiritually charged. A visit to Huangguosho Waterfalls will be well worth the trip, this group of waterfalls in Guizhou are very famous. There are many spectacular lakes in China as well. The Tianchi, or Heavenly Pool, lies almost two thousand metres above sea level and over a hundred metres deep; it is a divine spot to sit and contemplate.</p>

However, one can waste a lot of time searching for documents that they need. An employee stores files all over several network drives and even some individual desktops.</p>
<p>When project leaders brew up a new project, they have to look for team members and hold meetings. Then emails starts flying back and forth and soon important documents emerge. These documents get passed around and around within a couple of weeks and a couple of dozen phone calls on top of it. Soon enough, everybody feels overwhelmed with everyone else’s inbox filled with slightly different versions of the same document. Also, one is unsure if they do have the latest version. Hence, it is impossible to see a complete snapchat of the entire project. It is just too difficult to connect all data.</p>
<h2>The ease of Microsoft Application for the travel industry is beneficial in all aspects.</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://datacon.dk/loesninger/english">It offers solutions that contain all industry specific functionalities</a>. The ease of creating an online home for the project by starting a new <a href="http://webvine.com.au/">Microsoft Sharepoint</a> site comes pretty handy. For example, to help fill up the team, one can easily identify potential team members with special skills using the search button. Within minutes travel agents can be found to <a href="http://www.techworld.com/apps/microsoft-sharepoint-2013-how-good-is-new-office-collaboration-suite-3380818/">collaborate </a>on a certain project. Once the team is formed, employees can even learn that they have more in common, thanks to Sharepoint blogs. They will be able to know and <a href="https://www.implexis-solutions.com/collaboration/en/sharepoint-solutions">share common interests thus help build relationships that create a solid team foundation</a>.</p>
<p>For projects, you have a little to worry about attachments and version control, Microsoft Sharepoint becomes the <a href="https://www.otssolutions.com/travel-hospitality.html">source </a>for everything related to the project. All documents contained in Sharepoint will only have one version. The same is true for calendars. The team shared calendars means no one has to guess about meeting times or due dates, customer bookings and future trips. Travel agents can soon realize that whenever they need budget spreadsheets and presentations, it comes easy. Instead of employees having to start from scratch, they can search Sharepoint for documents from other projects that can help them get started quickly. The same is true for existing data bases and networks within the travel company.</p>
<p><a href="http://webvine.com.au/">Microsoft Sharepoint</a> plugs into these systems so that the team can assess bookings data,inventory and contact information. I<a href="http://www.tatvasoft.co.uk/technology/sharepoint-development.php">t creates a home that not only connects information but allows the company to see the big picture</a>. Employees can always look forward to the next project even while they are on vacation too.</p>

		<p style="text-align: justify;">There are many marketing opportunities when travelling in <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/international/21601028-how-growing-chinese-middle-class-changing-global-tourism-industry-coming">China</a>. It is a very big country and there are very many people, some 1.391 billion people in fact. Marketing on the <a href="http://www.chinatourism.ch/">mainland</a>: Opportunities in travel are opening up every day in so many possible ways. What do people want? They want good experiences and mementoes of those good experiences to take back home with them. They want good food to eat and tasty drinks to wash it all down with. Tourists want to see and hear colourful things, shows and performances. So, there are sponsorship opportunities for smart companies that wish to be associated with such positive excitement.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"> Marketing on the Mainland: Opportunities in Travel</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You have a group of people that are under tight direction; a market at the mercy of those in control. The <a href="http://www.cnto.org/with-expansion-of-international-tourism-china-leads-outbound-growth/">tour</a> bus is their constant vessel and their prison to some degree. What is on the walls on display is a platform offering advertisers the opportunity to communicate a highly repetitive message to this audience; whether it be through TV screens or signage. Members of this tour bus can be given caps, pens, coffee mugs and clothing items all embossed with a company sponsor logo. Together they are a bonded team and this makes for a fertile audience in psychologically terms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When they see amazing new things together they want to talk and share with each other about what they have seen. Experiences shared are reinforced by this kind of behaviour; another powerful opportunity for sponsors to cement their positive association with good times. Companies that are involved in the travel business through things like traveller’s cheques, credit cards, international mobile phone carriers, guide books and travel websites can all take advantage of this captive audience to promote their products. <a href="http://www.marketim.com.au">Marketing strategies</a> like these don’t get much better.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The digital world needs to pair with real live experiences in the sensory realm to consolidate its impact and travel marketing makes this possible. The tourist, if properly guided, is an incredibly fertile marketing portal, and a whole group of them together is a great opportunity for marketers everywhere. You can sell to, and, more importantly, create brand ambassadors via these tourists if your marketing and the tour are well managed. <a href="http://www.bitechina.com.cn/en/page/16/home.html">China</a> is a big new experience for these people and they will want some corporate friends to share the journey with them. Familiarity in the right places can ease some travel stress; and if they keep seeing your logo in these foreign climes they will be signed on for life, in some circumstances.</p>

This peninsula city is also said to be <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/may/11/macau-gambling-capital-of-world"><span class="s2">bigger than Las Vegas</span></a> in terms of profits, thanks to gambling. In fact, the government of Macau gets almost half of its revenues from gambling, which is also why tourists across the globe flock here to try their luck. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In every direction, you’ll see hotels and casinos exorbitantly ornamented with impressive chandeliers inside while the exteriors are lighted impressively, which add to the city’s glitz and glamour. <a href="https://www.worldcasinodirectory.com/macau/casino-list"><span class="s2">Casinos in Macau</span></a> are always thronged with gamblers and tourists playing roulette, blackjack, poker and slot machines, among others.

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Gambling Activities in Macau</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Gamblers and tourists can take part in different gambling activities in Macau. Generally, these are categorised into casino games, <a href="http://www.onlinebetting.com/legal/macau/sports/"><span class="s2">greyhound</span></a> racing, sports betting and lotteries. Online gambling is also popular in Macau; however, those interested in making a wager can only do so from two websites. <span class="s2">Horse race betting</span> is facilitated by Macau Jockey Club while sports betting is accessible via <a href="http://www.macauslot.com" target="_blank">Macauslot’s</a> online portal. Online gamblers can place their bets in different horse race events in Macau and other neighbouring cities, and even in Australia by visiting associated websites such as <a href="https://www.betsfree.com.au">www.betsfree.com.au</a> and some key Asian cities such as Hong Kong. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On-course and off-course <span class="s2">horse race betting</span> and greyhound racing are among the favourites of gamblers in Macau. For horse races alone, there are at least 210 race betting on-course terminals and 80 off-course terminals in and around the city.

		<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, I don’t think that we will be seeing too many <a href="http://www.thegreynomads.com.au/sleeping-giant-wakes-up-to-joys-of-grey-nomad-lifestyle/">grey nomads</a> on the roads in China with their caravans swaying behind them in the shadow of the Great Wall. Much more likely, to have a whole bunch of them sitting snug inside their comfy tour bus and listening to the sing-song chatter of their Chinese tour guide. Grey nomads in China: Travel for retirees, yes Siree, they are on the move and coming to a tourist attraction near you. Whether it be the Entombed Warriors – The Terracotta Army or The Forbidden City (nothing is forbidden when you are over sixty) these older folk will be chewing the fat with cameras and IPhones outstretched.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Grey Nomads in China: Travel for Retirees</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your retiree has, generally, paid his or her dues to society, gone to work each and every day, brought up a family, maybe fought in a war, set up a <a href="http://smsfs.biz">SMSF</a>; and now they are ready to see the world. Could be a cruise around the Pacific, through <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-36328464">Asia</a>, or flying direct into Beijing and getting on a tour bus to see the many sights that <a href="http://www.chinapost.com.tw/china/">China</a> has to offer. Buddhist Pagodas might be on the menu, the Temple of Heaven, the Shilin Stone forest, the Wudang Mountains, Tiger Leaping Gorge, or the Mogao Caves; to name just a few amazing sights in China.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/china/">China</a> is full of incredible things to do and see. Don’t forget Hong Kong and Macao and all that yummy food, gambling and nightlife. How about a Yangtze River cruise to blow the cobwebs from your mind? Hang out at the Hanging Monastery! Pipe up in the Reed Flute Cave and prepare yourself to be truly amazed. If grottoes are your thing, then the <a href="http://www.touropia.com/tourist-attractions-in-china/">Longman Grottoes</a> will tower above your expectations.  The Hani Terraces will show you what a really big canvas looks like when painted with hundreds of years of agriculture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Grey nomads will never be the same after a trip to the Middle Kingdom. Their ideas about China and Chinese people will be given a giant push into another dimension. They say that travel broadens the mind, well, travel in China stretches it like life does to skin over six or seven decades. Experience makes us who we are; and lives well-lived in are a bit like China, they may not look all sleek and perfect on the outside, but they sure know what life is all about.</p>

		<img width="300" height="200" src="http://www.itravelqq.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Death_to_stock_communicate_hands_9--300x200.jpg" class="attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image" alt="" srcset="http://www.itravelqq.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Death_to_stock_communicate_hands_9--300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.itravelqq.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Death_to_stock_communicate_hands_9--768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.itravelqq.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Death_to_stock_communicate_hands_9--1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://www.itravelqq.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Death_to_stock_communicate_hands_9-.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="p1"><span class="s1">By 2030, it is expected that tourists coming from the Asia-Pacific region will account to at least half of the world’s international travellers. Forty percent of this number will be Chinese holidaymakers. More so, it is seen that China will surpass the United States in terms of travel-market. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But why the Chinese travel industry?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to UNWTO, holidaymakers from <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/asia/china/"><span class="s2">China</span></a> shelled out 30 percent more from their holiday trips in 2012 than in 2011. These expenses are growing and growing each year. In fact, the Chinese spent $102 billion on their international excursions that same year. By 2030, it will balloon to at least $1.8 trillion. That’s why everyone wants a piece of those Chinese travelers. Luckily, we will provide you 5 promotion tips on growing a Chinese travel company.</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="s1">1. Segment the Chinese travellers</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Group them using different metrics (age, social status, gender, etc.). This will help you to easily monitor the behaviour, attitude and spending of pattern of Chinese tourists. In turn, you will be able to prioritise your target market, make wise investment choices, create a competitive marketing strategy and provide more efficient services. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Based on trends, these segments will travel more outside China by 2030: young, well off Chinese; senior executives; and groups of friends or families. You can exploit these sectors and make a profit by offering attractive tour packages that will suit their taste and lifestyle. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">2. Create a localised webpage</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Probably one of the best things you could do to introduce your travel company is to create a localised webpage. According to statistics, around 96% of tour reservations made by Chinese holidaymakers occur on webpages that are in the Chinese language. For instance, look at <a href="http://daodao.com"><span class="s2">daodao.com</span></a>, TravelAdvisor’s brand in China. In Australia, <a href="http://www.australia.cn/"><span class="s2">Tourism Australia</span></a> and <a href="http://www.experienceoz.com.zh/"><span class="s2">Experience Oz</span></a> have websites customised for Chinese travellers. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">3. Partner with local companies in China</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Aside from creating localised content, Chinese consumers expect international brands or services to be presented to them in a local way. That being said, make use of Online Payment Services in China such as Alipay and Tenpay.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">4. Capitalise on social media</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In some cases, traditional marketing isn’t as effective as social media marketing. However, you can still invest on standard <a href="http://www.bepromoted.com.au"><span class="s2">promotional items</span></a>. Harness your inner creativity to elevate your publicity campaigns. More so, promote your travel company and the services you provide using popular socia media channels like Weibo and Renren. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">5. Encourage your clients to write positive reviews</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They say that “reputation is revenue.” As a matter of fact, 81% of tourists rely on travel reviews while around 49% of them will only book a package tour after reading the write-ups. Encourage your clients to post positive reviews based on their experiences in your website or on social media. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By following these tips, we are confident that your business will have the cutting edge and succeed in Chinese tourism. </span></p>

		<p style="text-align: justify;">Chiropractors have conquered the great divide between East and West. You will find chiropractors in China: Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. These great cities and more are now home to the healing hands of professionally trained chiropractors. In some ways, Chiro is an American modality, and like many successful American things it too has now been exported across the globe. It is not only Hollywood and McDonalds starring on screens and streets in China, Chiro is making a big impact on the shores of the Middle Kingdom.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Chiropractors in China: Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sport’s science has helped lead the way for the <a href="http://completechirocare.com.au">chiropractor</a> in China, to some extent, with things like the massive <a href="http://www.canadianchiropractor.ca/collaboration/chiropractors-in-beijing-1380">Beijing Olympic Games</a>. Chiropractors on national sporting teams from countries like the USA, Canada, the Bahamas and the Philippines all made their presence felt. It could only be a matter of time before opportunities were taken up by expat chiropractors and local Chinese people wishing to train. China is a huge untapped market for Chiro, and people are only just beginning to realise that. It is still just a drop in the ocean at the moment, but it will grow, as it is already showing signs of.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chiropractors in China: Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong are servicing expats and local Chinese, who have heard about the efficacy of chiropractic. Chiro may well be from a completely different background to Traditional Chinese Medicine and expressions of that, like acupuncture, but in many ways it shares some attributes. Both modalities are very outcome based in their pragmatic methodology to healing. People in China are in a hurry to achieve outcomes, like Western levels of middle class wealth, and they want the lifestyles and accoutrements that go with that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chiropractic healing is a very practical Western way of healing; it is fast and effective. Many of the local people working around one of the American expat chiropractors working in <a href="http://www.bbc.com/sport/36314823">Beijing</a> want to train and become <a href="http://www.worldchiropracticalliance.org/">chiropractors</a> themselves. I can see more Western chiropractors coming and working here, and many Chinese people training to become chiropractors. We have seen this development happening in other countries, like Australia and the UK. This is an <a href="http://www.dynamicchiropractic.com/mpacms/dc/article.php?id=51272">American</a> export industry with a proven track record of success. The <a href="http://www.olympic.org/news/rio-2016">Olympic Games</a> was a great help, and that positive association with Chiro continues to aid  its development in places like China. Athletes love their chiro, so it appears very attractive to everyone else.</p>

		<p style="text-align: justify;"><em></em><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-19/china-seen-faking-488-million-internet-posts-to-divert-criticism">China</a> has over 1.319 billion people and they have all their own digital platforms for social media. So, social media is very big in China, like everything else in China, big big big BIG! When you want to reach that big audience in China it pays to know and understand the social media options they have on offer. You may have a product or service that you wish to market in <a href="http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/incidents/china-erupts-with-fury-over-footage-of-women-being-assaulted-in-hotel/news-story/997e8b0be277c6128f4a1f97c2163831">China</a>; and social media can fan some flames of interest for you. Here is a brief rundown of what to expect and what each platform can specifically offer.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Chinese Social Media: When in China</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are over 300 million people using <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-33898634">social media in China</a>, so, that is a huge market to reach. A <a href="http://sydneysocialmediamanagers.com.au">social media management agency</a> could work wonders with these kinds of numbers. Looking at the top five social media apps in the Chinese market, they each have particular pros and cons.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sina Weibo &#8211; Looking at the multifunction capabilities of this very popular app, you can see why they call it the <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/understanding-social-media-in-china">Chinese</a> Twitter (and that has nothing to do with Mah-jong). It has the ability to share images and videos; and it is the most popular app for Chinese celebrities wishing to interact with their many fans. Sina Weibo has twice the number of users that Twitter does, which just goes to show how big a place China really is. This app can help marketers reach a giant sized audience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tencent &#8211; This app is really an instant messenger using the QQ platform. It does, however, allow users to share images and videos, and to update their status. It also, incorporates numerous different websites on the one platform; meaning that Tencent has the largest number of registered users in China. It does have its own social networking site called Pengyou. This app, again, offers marketers and advertisers a huge audience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Douban &#8211; Boasting around 80 million active users every month, Douban, is an open forum style platform, which is mainly used for movie, book and music reviews. Being an open forum it allows unregistered users to access many of its features, which may be attractive to marketers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Renren &#8211; This could be called the Facebook of China, as it encourages users to connect with their friends, update their status, share videos, images, music and links. It has around 150 million registered users and over 30 million people actively using it every month.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">WeChat &#8211; This mobile chat and voice app allows its users to discover each other through friend discovery, which identifies other WeChat users in the area. It is China’s Premier instant messaging app and currently it has more than 100 million people using it.</p>

			<span class="entry-date"><a href="http://www.itravelqq.com/china-intolerant-to-sex-tourists/" rel="bookmark"><span class="byline-icon fa fa-clock-o" aria-hidden="true"></span><span class="screen-reader-text">Date: </span><time class="entry-date" datetime="2016-05-12T23:37:59+00:00">May 12, 2016</time></a></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="byline"><span class="author vcard"><a class="url fn n" href="http://www.itravelqq.com/author/dcdndjkbsv37sgn/" rel="author"><span class="byline-icon fa fa-user" aria-hidden="true"></span><span class="screen-reader-text">Author: </span>Huan Yue Chiang</a></span></span>		</div><!-- .entry-meta -->

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p style="text-align: justify;">The official position of the Chinese government is one of intolerance toward the sex tourism market. It is important to understand that sex tourism is about economics. Men from wealthier countries travel to poorer countries to have sex there cheaply. They literally get more bang for their buck in these places. China sees itself as the regional economic power in Asia. There are <a href="http://ro.uow.edu.au/lhapapers/482/">Chinese</a> men travelling to poorer parts of Asia to have sex with the women there. The Chinese government does not condone <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-24487270">prostitution</a>, but for many single Chinese men it is the only sexual outlet open to them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">China is not particularly interested in being a sex tourism destination for Westerners and is happy to see them visiting countries in South-East-Asia instead. Thailand and <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/indonesian-villagers-mistook-sex-toy-for-angel">Indonesia</a> are favourite stop-overs for men seeking cheap sex in foreign countries. A recent visit involving four hundred Japanese men travelling to China for sex with five hundred local prostitutes garnered a great deal of bad press for the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/30/international/asia/30ORGY.html">Japanese</a>. No nation likes to think about people from other countries coming over and fucking their women; it is a patriotically sensitive issue. Especially in this case when you remember what the Japanese did in China during the Second World War.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"> China Intolerant to Sex Tourists</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Countries that do turn a blind eye to sex tourism in return for the economic windfall it delivers, usually do so because they have little alternative. These places are most often resource poor and have little, or no other, industries contributing to the nation’s economy. Many island nations like Malta, and the Pacific island nations are in this situation. With <a href="https://myplaymate.com.au/escorts-perth">escorts</a> and the income derived from their activities making up a large part of the revenue coming into these places. Which is why, local residents are so keen to see their children try and make a life elsewhere if possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is one of the brutal realities of poverty, the wealthy will screw you any way they can. Lady-boys in Thailand and elsewhere are generating quite a bit of sex tourism from the West and other places. The homosexual and bisexual markets are joining the traditional heterosexual market to make countries like Thailand international commercial sex hubs. The way the world is set-up right now you cannot eradicate prostitution; it would be more constructive to put energy into making the industry hygienically safer for both sex workers and their clients.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Barely six years after it was launched, AirBnB is now estimated at $30 billion. Some say that if you have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jul/13/rent-out-your-spare-room" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a spare room in your house</a>, you are actually sitting on a gold mine. But that is not always the case. In fact, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/pauline-paquin/can-you-make-money-as-an-_b_9805612.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">making profits through AirBnB</a> is one of the few challenges that AirBnB hosts are confronted with. That said, it is still possible to <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/237400" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raise your income</a>, but you should be prepared to exert a lot of effort, make sacrifices, and release your inner creativity. The key here is to be ready and willing to make an investment. One of the AirBnB tips that we can give you is to get a renovation so that you can raise your income. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>AirBnB Tips: Get A Renovation And Raise Your Income</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The first step in growing your AirBnB income is to remodel your place. This can range from simple improvements, such as adding new appliances or repainting the walls, to drastic changes, like installing new floors or widening the room. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When <a href="http://www.hgtv.com/remodel/interior-remodel/how-to-begin-a-living-room-remodel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting a room renovation</a>, one of the most important AirBnB tips that you should remember is to focus on your kitchen and bathroom. Why? Because these spaces are the first things that <a href="http://www.itravelqq.com/chinese-medicine-attracts-health-conscious-tourists/">a prospective tenant wants to see</a>. No one would book a property with dirty and shabby kitchen and bathrooms. If you are looking for <a href="https://dreamdoorskitchens.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">kitchen ideas</span></a> for your kitchen’s new look, you can find some inspiration in magazines and interiour design websites. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As an AirBnB host, you can also <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/increase-the-value-of-your-property-2124841" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increase the value of your property</a> by building on some add-ons. If your property is a stone’s throw away from the beach, you might want to consider getting snorkel gears or surf boards that your tenants can use. In addition, try to modernise the look of your property. Refurbish it with new furniture, decórs, and appliances, especially for your kitchen and bathrooms. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Facts About Renovating Your Property for AirBnB</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One reason why you should <a href="http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/home/interiors/want-to-add-value-by-renovating-your-property-dont-do-this/news-story/1448e52b6def7d4b8f3ceb0a1c13246b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovate your property right now</a> for AirBnB is that you can triple your income. For instance, a decent room in outer Sydney costs $200 per week prior to renovation. Throwing in the equation the seasonal fluctuations and other factors, a newly furnished property in the outskirts of Sydney can easily be rented out for $700 per week. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Some hosts are having second thoughts in renovating their property because of the work and the costs associated with it, and the space requirements to pull off an amazing property. But you know what? You don’t need a gargantuan space to create a hotel suite. Just furnish the space smartly, add a dash of creativity, and manage your budget wisely. </span></p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Did you know that the Chinese tourism industry is one of the fastest growing in the world? Together with this upsurge is the increase in hotel development, which is at its highest since the end of the country’s Cultural Revolution. What are the circumstances that have led to the spark in the growth of the country’s tourism and hospitality industry? Is this growth one of the moving factors for its rising economy?</p>
<p><strong>The Late Bloomer</strong><br />
Compared to other countries, China can be considered as a late bloomer to the international tourism market. Despite being so, it has undoubtedly become part of the top 10 travel destinations in the world – a distinction it has held since 1994.</p>
<p>One of the reasons being credited for this dominating entry into the international tourism industry is the shift in its policy when it opened its economy some time in 1978. With disposable income becoming available to its citizens, a sizable <a href="http://www.cnto.org">Chinese domestic and outbound tourism market</a> was created. However, sustainability is another challenge that needs to be hurdled.</p>
<p>As far as Chinese tourism industry is concerned, hotel development is a critical and major factor. Perhaps this is why majority of the hotel industry in China is strongly influenced by international hotel development trends; something that has worked to keep its tourism industry vibrant.</p>
<p>The Chinese tourism and hospitality industry also benefits from outsourcing critical operations that have resulted in sound compensation and incentive management of workers, well-planned travel services, and responsive human resources. It is worthwhile noting that along with tourism, China is also a growing destination for <a href="http://isapience.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business process outsourcing</a> like the Philippines and India particularly for information technology and manufacturing.</p>
<p>Even if China is considered a late bloomer, it has posted impressive digits. If we are to believe the figures from the China National Tourism Administration, the 4.44 billion domestic travels the country has generated in 2016 is nothing to laugh at. In fact, this alone has generated $MB3.9 trillion in terms of domestic tourism revenue.</p>
<p>Obviously, such a sizeable amount would be enough to stir local economy. When you factor in the additional 260 million inbound and outbound travels, then it isn’t difficult to see why this late bloomer is such a force in the international tourism market.</p>
<p>The expanding middle class households of China are another factor in the rapid growth and developments experienced by the industry. The disposable income that this segment of society has amassed has made not only domestic air travel more affordable, but the impact has even overflowed to road and rail networks.</p>
<p>This means that more and more Chinese families are taking advantage of weekend getaways, short stay packages, and other low cost premium travel packages. For the tourism and hospitality industry, this has given birth to the proliferation of mid-scale hotels that target the Chinese middle class.</p>
<p>Not to be taken aback, the typical holiday group tours still continue. This movement in the tourism industry is partly responsible for sustaining the existence of the traditionally large and luxurious big grand hotels. With more and more Chinese tourists expressing interest in unique travel experiences, it is seen that the Chinese tourism industry will continue to rise.</p>
<p><strong>New Breed of Travelers</strong><br />
The new breed of domestic travelers is seen as responsible for shaping the future of the Chinese tourism industry. This emerging group of travelers will help move the industry towards practical travels and hotels.</p>
<p>It is understood that this demand will co-exists with the traditional tour groups and luxury hotels. But these <a href="http://www.webintravel.com/meet-chinas-new-wave-travellers-young-free-independent-affluent-sophisticated" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new breed of travelers</a> have made hoteliers look at the attractive prospects that boutique hotels may bring. These types of hotels focus mainly on creating a unique and memorable experience for its guests by delivering a lifestyle focused on stylish design, sensual cuisine, and amazing locations.</p>
<p>These boutique hotels may also be the right solution to the consistently growing wellness tourism in China. These types of hotels can offer and integrate a variety of health experiences that will allow tourists to experience lifestyle changes through coaching and relaxation that can help to de stress both the body and mind.</p>
<p>Not to be confused with the yoga, spa, and detox programs offered by other wellness resorts, much of the wellness tourism industry in China focuses on a more traditional approach using traditional Chinese medication that is prescribed to the guests by in-house physicians.</p>
<p>Even the eco-resorts in the country bring to focus of environmental sustainability to attract local and foreign travelers. By adhering to green initiatives, many of the players in the hospitality industry have found huge operational savings by investing in the growing environmental tourism market.</p>
<p><strong>Alliances and Ventures</strong><br />
You cannot take away the element of fun from travel, otherwise you will be looking at a doomed tourism and hospitality industry. This is perhaps the reason why these is also a huge spike in the appearance of themed hotels that are fast becoming a constant presence in the country just like the Disneyland Hotel and Toy Story Hotel in Shanghai for example.</p>
<p>Investing on these types of themed tourist attractions can mean tremendous strain on budgets because of competition. However, by using strategic alliances and joint ventures, it has made it possible for China to keep much of its domestic tourists at home. This means that spending is kept within the country instead of competing for it with international brands outside. The Marriot International merger with Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide is one such example. The outsourcing in the Chinese tourism and hospitality industry will result in more high-end brand hotels at lesser cost.</p>
<p>The presence of high-end hospitality brands is nothing new in China. In fact, Sheraton, Hyatt, Intercontinental, and Marriott have been on the scene for a couple of decades now. The difference is that this time, they are more than just hotel managers and operators. Foreign investment is mixing into the capital of local developers to help create and sustain the China&#8217;s tourism industry.</p>
<p>Of course, for foreign investors, this comes at a hefty price considering that all lands in China are owned by the government. But the alliance with local developers, especially well-connected ones make it easier to acquire financing and planning approvals from the state-owned banks.</p>
<p>Will the entry of foreign investment give additional boost to the tourism and hospitality industry? With the perception of bureaucracy and protectionism combined with the complex legal system in China, only time will tell.</p>
<p><strong>Investing Abroad</strong><br />
Are you aware that during recent years the <a href="http://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/05/chinese-overseas-investment-is-changing-and-the-rest-of-the-world-will-learn-from-latin-america" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outbound investments of China</a> have been consistently increasing? For example, in 2016, the country’s investments in Europe, the United States, and other overseas markets have reached US$161 billion or roughly 80% higher than what it was in 2015. One major result of such investments was the acquisition of a quarter of the Hilton Worldwide Holdings for roughly US$6.5 billion.</p>
<p>How does investing abroad relate to the outsourcing in the Chinese tourism&nbsp; industry? For one, being part owner of some of the recognizable hotel brands will help develop the local hotels at a lower cost. Part ownership can also help influence the influx of trendier themed hotels to support the growing demand from the Chinese middle class travelers.</p>
<p>With new government-supported areas like Lijiang, Guilin, Xian, Chengdu, and Shangri La, the government will benefit from the additional influence that these overseas investments can bring. As the number of international tourists continue to rise, it is seen that the government will relax its visa issuance guidelines.</p>
<p>The way that it stands, it looks like the Chinese tourism industry will continue to enjoy the increase in both local and international travelers.</p>
