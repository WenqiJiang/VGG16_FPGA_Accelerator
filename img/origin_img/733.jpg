		<p>ATLANTA &#8212; Gov. Brian Kemp declared a state of emergency in three Georgia counties after a series of deadly tornados struck central and southwest Georgia and Alabama on Sunday. The governor&#8217;s office said on Monday that more counties could be added to the list that includes Grady, Harris and Talbot counties. A state of emergency allows state resources to help residents recover from disasters.</p>
<p>&#8220;With extensive storm damage in Grady, Harris, and Talbot counties, it is imperative that we take swift action to help affected Georgians and deploy state resources in ongoing response and recovery efforts,&#8221; Kemp said late Monday morning. &#8220;This declaration immediately dispatches additional first responders and assistance as we continue to assess the damage. Throughout this process, I have received regular updates from state and local leaders. Based on this information, I will travel to affected areas this afternoon with emergency management personnel to witness the damage firsthand.&#8221;</p>
<p>The death toll climbed to 23 Monday after the powerful storm system generated multiple tornadoes that leveled homes and businesses in Alabama and Georgia. Rescuers prepared to continue sifting through a debris field Monday that stretched a half-mile wide in rural Lee County in eastern Alabama. The rubble includes pieces of mobile homes, trees, power lines, vehicles, restaurants and even a cell tower.</p>
<p>A tornado that swept through Lee County packed winds of around 160 mph or more. It left a path of destruction that county Sheriff Jay Jones called &#8220;incredible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Witnesses described what sounds like a war zone.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was just destruction,&#8221; Levi Baker, who lives nearby, told The Associated Press. &#8220;There were mobile homes gone. Frames on the other side of the road.&#8221;</p>
<p>Baker said he used a chain saw to help clear a path for ambulances and other first responders. He saw both people and animals dead, and said some houses had been destroyed. One house was swept off its foundation and sat in the middle of a roadway.</p>
<p>Both adults and children were among the dead. The youngest victim was 6 years old, the sheriff said. CNN reported that as many as a dozen tornadoes touched down across Alabama and Georgia.</p>
<p>The NWS confirmed the first tornado was at least an EF-3 and measured about a half-mile wide.<br />
Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey tweeted that state emergency officials are assisting local governments.</p>
<p>Numerous tornado warnings were posted across parts of Alabama, Georgia, Florida and South Carolina on Sunday afternoon. Around 3:10 p.m., the Lee County emergency officials tweeted that a possible tornado was on the ground near Highway 51. Residents in Smith&#8217;s Station were told to seek shelter immediately.</p>
<p>Around 8 p.m. a possible tornado was reported in Cairo, Georgia. Damage was reported in that community as well.</p>

<p>ATLANTA, Ga. (CBS46)- Atlanta City Council is making an effort to track and monitor all scooter-related injuries to possibly add more safety requirements.</p>
<p>Zella Turner said she rode a scooter to and from work downtown everyday for months, until January 24 when she was thrown off her JUMP scooter while riding downhill on her way home from work. She said the scooter would not stop.</p>
<p>“I am absolutely sure those breaks weren’t working,” Turner told CBS46 reporter Hayley Mason. “That wasn’t my first time riding a scooter. I know how to stop a scooter,” she said.</p>
<p>Turner was thrown off the Jump scooter and sent to the hospital. She has fractured facial bones, more than a dozen stitches in her cheek, injured fingers and is wearing an arm brace. She is suing Uber over her accident and said she wants other riders to be thoughtful when signing the waivers associated with e-scooters.</p>
<p>She said the e-scooter owners will not acknowledge fault because of the waiver she signed.</p>
<p>“There is no liability on their part and people are assuming the machine is right and if it’s not then that’s a problem,” Turner said. “If I have an accident and the reason I have an accident is because your product is defective, that’s not my fault. I did everything I was supposed to do,” she added.</p>
<p>Atlanta City Council President Felicia Moore just filed possible legislation to track scooter-related injuries. She is asking hospitals and urgent care facilities to provide quarterly scooter injury reports.</p>
<p>“I think at minimum helmets are something they need to consider, and when we get this data in and determine the type of injuries, maybe that will the policy makers make that decision,” Moore said.</p>
<p>Atlanta emergency room physicians told us they are seeing more patients with serious injuries from scooter accidents.</p>
<p>“Initially when scooters started to become more popular, we were seeing about 20 or 30 a month and that number has gradually increased to now seeing about 100 a month,” said Dr. Hany Atallah, the Chief of Emergency Medicine at Grady Hospital. “We have seen a number of patients with some pretty significant head injuries, and we’ve seen a lot of patients with arm and wrist fractures and things from falling on the scooters.</p>
<p>He said they’re also treating more pedestrians who have been hit by scooters.</p>
<p>“If there are a lot of head injuries like I am hearing, then we perhaps need to do like other cities and say that you have to have a helmet,” Moore said. “In worse case scenario, if we find that the injuries are so significant and trying to find out more about how they fell off, we may have to look at if these are even safe to be traveling on our streets,” added Moore.</p>
<p>Moore met Turner during the taping of CBS46’s interview. Turner vowed to be at the upcoming public safety committee meeting next week at Atlanta’s City Hall.</p>
<p>Grady Hospital is about to enter a period of study in which doctors will count scooter-related injuries with specificity.</p>
<p>CBS46 has requested comment from Uber, they sent the following statement:</p>
<p>&#8220;We are upset to hear of this report and have Ms. Turner in our thoughts as she recovers. As soon as this was reported to us, we immediately removed this scooter from the JUMP fleet.&#8221;</p>

<p>ATLANTA, Ga. (CBS46)- After months of testing, elevated levels of arsenic have been found in the drinking water at USP Atlanta, a medium security facility housing close to 2,000 male offenders.</p>
<p>USP Atlanta brought in a third party consultant to conduct limited water sampling in November 2018 after questions were raised related to possible sediment in the water.</p>
<p>Because results from the first testing indicated elevated levels of arsenic, more widespread sampling of the institution was conducted in December. Test results were completed January 2, 2019; however due to the government shutdown the results were not received by the Bureau until January 29.</p>
<p>All of the samples tested with water collected within USP Atlanta contained 17 ppb of arsenic or less. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has established the maximum contaminant level (MCL) for arsenic in drinking water as 10 parts per billion (ppb).</p>
<p>Staff and inmates were notified to not drink the water and bottled water was distributed to staff and inmates.</p>
<p>The City of Atlanta Department of Watershed Management (DWM), who supplies water to the facility, was also notified of the test results. They conducted preliminary testing on February 4, 2019, to determine the source of the arsenic and what further action may be required. Those test results have not yet been received.</p>
<p>In the interim, additional gallons of water were purchased for the Food Services Department to use in cooking meals during this time. Staff conducted town hall meetings with all the housing units to ensure inmates were notified not to drink or cook with the tap water. Showers and washing of clothes are not affected by this issue. Staff and inmates continue to be provided with clean drinking water via bottled water and notices have been posted as a reminder.</p>

		<p>Whole Foods Market today opened its first Whole Foods Market 365 stores in Atlanta.</p>
<p>The new locations &mdash; at 1555 Church St. in Decatur, Ga., and 3535 Northside Pkwy. in the Buckhead section of Atlanta &mdash; expand the 365 retail banner to 12 stores.</p>
<p>Compared with conventional Whole Foods supermarkets, which average around 38,000 square feet and can range up to 50,000 square feet, the 365 stores run about 25,000 to 30,000 square feet. The smaller format also carries about 7,000 SKUs, less than half of the 20,000-plus SKUs at full-size Whole Foods stores, and doesn&rsquo;t include full-service departments such as deli or bakery.</p>
<p>In addition, the 365 banner features lower prices than the typical Whole Foods, which was billed as a key element of the concept when it launched in 2016. The combination of cheaper prices and smaller size, as well as a local flavor, is seen as opening up more expansion possibilities for the format in terms of space and location.</p>
<p>The new 365 store in the Buckhead section of Atlanta, inside and out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited to introduce the Decatur and Northside Buckhead communities to the Whole Foods Market 365 concept, offering the very best quality food at low prices,&rdquo; Jeff Turnas, president of Whole Foods Market 365, said in a statement. &ldquo;We have taken all we have learned about combining convenience and customer experience and created what we believe are two of our most exciting stores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Decatur and Buckhead locations are part of the Friends of Whole Foods Market program, which brings unique, locally based beverage and dining experiences in-store via partnerships with outside chefs and culinary and lifestyle brands. Whole Foods said All Friends partners operate as independent shops inside its stores and share the retailer&rsquo;s high quality standards.</p>
<p>For example, the Decatur 365 store marks the fourth location for Atlanta-based dtox juice. Its menu includes juices, smoothies, acai, matcha and dragon fruit bowls, nut-based yogurt, plant-based salads, and detoxifying cleanses made with organic and local ingredients. Another Atlanta business, Sublime Tree, opened its second location at the Buckhead store. The vendor focuses on organic smoothies, cold-pressed juices, smoothie bowls and superfood eats.</p>
<p>Also in the Decatur store is Pour de Leon, a beverage, dining and gathering venue for all ages, with the name inspired by Atlanta&#8217;s Ponce de Leon Avenue. The outlet offers locally and nationally sourced beers, wines and ciders on tap, hot bar bites with dipping sauces and grab-and-go prepared foods &mdash; as well as free classic arcade games.</p>
<p>Slated to open early next year in both the Decatur and Buckhead stores is Loteria Grill, an authentic Mexican restaurant, Loteria Grill led by chef Jimmy Shaw. Whole Foods said the eateries will be Los Angeles-based Loteria&rsquo;s first Atlanta-area locations. Offerings will include appetizers, tacos, enchiladas and seasonal specials; vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free options; a coffee bar; and beer, wine and cocktails.</p>
<p>Both of the new 365 stores offer more than 200 organic produce items and pre-cut vegetables, such as zucchini noodles and riced cauliflower; fresh meat and seafood, including specialty cuts, value packs and marinated items; and over 75 grab-and-go artisanal cheeses. Hot and cold bars enable shoppers to build their own salads and pick up ready-made wraps, sushi, Detroit-style square pizza by the slice, sandwiches, pastas, soups and breakfast tacos.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a made-to-order sandwich counter and fresh-baked bread and pastries from Atlanta&rsquo;s Alon&rsquo;s Bakery &amp; Market and H&amp;F Bread Co. Mix-and-match, self-serve bakery items include a cookie bar, macaron bar, cakes and pies. And a tablet-based beverage pairing kiosk lets customers scan wine, beer or spirit labels for food pairing ideas, ratings, user reviews and recommendations. You&rsquo;ll find more than 400 wines under $25, including eco-friendly and biodynamic wines. The stores, too, carry a wide selection of beer, including seasonal and local favorites, and special-occasion drinks like sparkling wine, sake and sangria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is an exciting opportunity for Whole Foods Market to serve more communities in Atlanta,&rdquo; said Bobby Turner, president of Whole Foods Market&rsquo;s South region. &ldquo;Not only are we bringing high-quality products at great prices with the Decatur and Buckhead stores, but we&rsquo;re also thrilled to be employing 200 people from the local communities between the two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other 10 Whole Foods 365 stores are in Ohio, California (five locations), New York, Oregon and Texas (two locations). On its website, Whole Foods lists more 365 stores in development for California, Indiana, New Jersey, Ohio and Virginia.</p>

		<p>ATLANTA, GA &#8212; GID and North American Properties have announced a new joint venture to develop High Street Atlanta, an eight million-square-foot mixed-use destination in the Central Perimeter. GID will remain the master developer, while NAP will lead retail leasing, marketing and community engagement. Once complete, NAP will oversee retail property management and the programming of High Street Atlanta&#8217;s public realm.</p>
<p>&quot;To bring High Street Atlanta to life, it was important for us to engage a local partner, particularly as it relates to retail, restaurant and entertainment leasing, who shared our vision for designing, programming and operating mixed-use destinations,&quot; said James Linsley, president of GID Development Group. &quot;The NAP team has demonstrated success with curating best-in-class merchandise mixes, engaging the community and energizing spaces so that they become the community&#8217;s gathering place. We are excited to begin working with the NAP team and to apply their proven approach to High Street Atlanta&#8217;s street-level retail and public realm.&quot;</p>
<p>The transit-oriented urban district features 10 city blocks developed around a pedestrian friendly street grid and active open space and event spaces. It will be highly walkable, with urban placemaking principles and modern architecture.</p>
<p>&quot;By investing in the space between the buildings &ndash; the street-level, human-scale gathering places where community and social collisions happen organically &ndash; we create a fundamentally different shopping experience than e-commerce,&quot; said Mark Toro, managing partner of NAP. &quot;It&#8217;s the difference between automation and animation; these two retail models are at opposite ends of the spectrum and both are highly successful, especially when they work together. Our team of ExperienceMakers&auml; looks forward to collaborating with GID to develop this highly animated urban environment for Central Perimeter.&quot;</p>
<p>At full build-out, the mix of uses includes approximately 1,500 apartments, 1,500 condos, 400,000 square feet of retail, 400,000 square feet of new office and 400 hotel rooms.</p>
<p>&quot;Today&#8217;s retailers are seeking to seamlessly integrate their brick and mortar and digital platforms. They want both an interactive in-store experience and a user friendly online experience; NAP provides the infrastructure for both,&quot; said David Weinert, partner and senior vice president of leasing at NAP. &quot;Heading into ICSC New York, one of the world&#8217;s largest retail conventions, we have dozens of meetings set up with a wide range of retailers, including digitally native brands looking to expand their real estate portfolios. We look forward to telling these unique-to-market concepts about High Street Atlanta and the Central Perimeter.&quot;</p>
<p>High Street Atlanta is located in the geographic center of the Central Perimeter, 15 miles north of downtown, steps away from MARTA and at the nexus of Georgia 400 and I-285. The Central Perimeter is in the economic center and heart of Metro Atlanta.</p>
<p>&quot;Vital to our approach is building community while building the community,&quot; Toro added. &quot;We invite community members to follow us on High Street Atlanta&#8217;s newly launched social media pages and share the types of retailers, restaurants, events and experiences they would like to see at the project using the hashtag #HighStATL. We will use the community&#8217;s feedback to help launch our leasing efforts at ICSC New York in early December.&quot;</p>
